# dashboard_react

1. **index.html** is rendered by the browser
1. ReactDOM in **index.js** renders Navbar+Dashboard (from **Dash.js**) into **index.html** at <div id="app">
1. **Dash.js** has most of the Components
1. **index.js** is a relict of HTML VanillaJS Times. I have to spend time integrate it in React. If you have patterns in mind to do it smoothly, let me know :)
